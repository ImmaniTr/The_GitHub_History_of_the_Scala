# The_GitHub_History_of_the_Scala

In the present work, an analysis of the history generated on GitHub by the open-source project Scala is conducted, with the aim of presenting important points to consider when contributing to projects on this collaborative development platform. The data spans from 2011 to 2018, and the project's activity has been examined in terms of the number of pull requests sent each month, as well as user activity and modified files. These points are highly relevant for conducting a more specific analysis, which includes identifying files with the latest contributions and collaborators with a higher number of requests. These characteristics are particularly important for identifying files with the potential for contributions that are likely to have a significant impact, and collaborators who can provide support to new users based on the knowledge they have gained through their interaction with the project.
